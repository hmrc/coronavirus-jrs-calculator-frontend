phaseTwoPensionBreakdown.l3.partial = Deduct £{0} (£{1} Lower Level of Qualifying Earnings for 20/21 tax year, divide by {2} days in pay period and multiply by {3} furlough days).
phaseTwoPensionBreakdown.l3.partTime = Deduct £{0} (£{1} Lower Level of Qualifying Earnings for 20/21 tax year, divide by {2} usual hours, multiply by {3} furlough hours).
phaseTwoPensionBreakdown.l3.partial.partTime = Deduct £{0} (£{1} Lower Level of Qualifying Earnings for 20/21 tax year, divide by {2} days in pay period and multiply by {3} furlough days, divide by {4} usual hours, multiply by {5} furlough hours).
